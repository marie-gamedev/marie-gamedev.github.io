# A Serious Game visualising CAR-T-Cell-Based Cancer Immunotherapy

## Abstract

This project presents the development of a serious game for MS Wissenschaft 2026, a traveling exhibition in Germany, designed to explain CAR-T cell–based immunotherapy. Following a user-centered engineering approach, the game integrates insights from related work on serious games, as well as museum and medical eductional games. Gameplay reflects key CAR-T therapy steps, while avoiding failure states and maintaining player engagement. Formative feedback during development and a summative evaluation after completion involve stakeholders and, where ethically feasible, cancer patients, ensuring the game is both educationally effective and emotionally sensitive.

## Usage

Double click the "**start\_game.bat**" file to launch the game.

* drag \& drop the CARs from the corners of the screen onto the green circles (T-Cells) to transform them into CAR-T-Cells.
* swish the engineered CAR-T-Cells towards Cancer Cells with a matching antigen to kill the Cancer Cells
